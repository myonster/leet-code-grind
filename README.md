8ms beats 92.59%
no.459 Repeated Substring Pattern 8/5/24
(better to use two pointer) my solution runs O(nlogn) but we can do it in O(n)

0ms beats 100%
no.66 Plus One 8/5/24
done iteratively

runtime: 0ms beats 100%
no. 1822 Signs of the Product on an Array
simple

runtime: 3ms beats 14%
no.1502 Can Make Arithmetic Progression From Sequence
simple 1. sort 2. check a[0] - a[1] and continue traversing

runtime: 1ms beats 98.59%
no.896 Monotonic Array
simple 1. set up 2 boolean condition => 1.presence of trend 2.increasing/decreasing ==> there will be a scenario where it just starts from 0 diff

runtime: 10ms beats 10%
no. 13 Roman to Integer
i used hashmap, solutions online used case and switch(have to learn more on this)
but both case it still O(n)

runtime: 0ms beats 100%
no. 58 Length of Last Word
simple built in java string methods => strip() to remove white spaces for edge cases and used lastIndexOf(" ")

runtime: 0ms beats 100%
no. 709. To Lower Case
simple built in syntax for java .toLowerCase();

runtime: 2ms beats 88%
no. 682 Baseball Game
used stack to peek pop and push different operations to maintain O(1) operations to ensure O(N) for the whole algo


runtime: 4ms beats 96.77%
no. 657 Robot Return to Origin
array size of 2 to depict x-y axis => each operation is used as moving along the graph
O(n) time

runtime: 0ms beats 100%
no. 1275 Find Winner on a Tic Tac Toe Game
Array question, i tackle it by giving making an large array so easier to count, there is 4 win con -> horizontal vertical and 2 diagonals for every position if we look at
it from a free space board, so overflowing position counts will be added but it will be +0 count; player A was given positive -1 count for his position
and player B was given -1 for his position, then we can just check if the one of the 4 win con adds up to +3 or -3.

runtime: 1ms beats 22%
no. 1041. Robot Bounded In Circle {MEDIUM}
loop it 4 times to see if it goes back to (0,0) => in recursion to find the last location,
maybe there is a better way?

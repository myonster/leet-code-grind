8ms beats 92.59%
no.459 Repeated Substring Pattern 8/5/24
(better to use two pointer) my solution runs O(nlogn) but we can do it in O(n)

0ms beats 100%
no.66 Plus One 8/5/24
done iteratively

runtime: 0ms beats 100%
no. 1822 Signs of the Product on an Array
simple

runtime: 3ms beats 14%
no.1502 Can Make Arithmetic Progression From Sequence
simple 1. sort 2. check a[0] - a[1] and continue traversing

runtime: 1ms beats 98.59%
no.896 Monotonic Array
simple 1. set up 2 boolean condition => 1.presence of trend 2.increasing/decreasing ==> there will be a scenario where it just starts from 0 diff

runtime: 10ms beats 10%
no. 13 Roman to Integer
i used hashmap, solutions online used case and switch(have to learn more on this)
but both case it still O(n)

runtime: 0ms beats 100%
no. 58 Length of Last Word
simple built in java string methods => strip() to remove white spaces for edge cases and used lastIndexOf(" ")

runtime: 0ms beats 100%
no. 709. To Lower Case
simple built in syntax for java .toLowerCase();

runtime: 2ms beats 88%
no. 682 Baseball Game
used stack to peek pop and push different operations to maintain O(1) operations to ensure O(N) for the whole algo


runtime: 4ms beats 96.77%
no. 657 Robot Return to Origin
array size of 2 to depict x-y axis => each operation is used as moving along the graph
O(n) time

runtime: 0ms beats 100%
no. 1275 Find Winner on a Tic Tac Toe Game
Array question, i tackle it by giving making an large array so easier to count, there is 4 win con -> horizontal vertical and 2 diagonals for every position if we look at
it from a free space board, so overflowing position counts will be added but it will be +0 count; player A was given positive -1 count for his position
and player B was given -1 for his position, then we can just check if the one of the 4 win con adds up to +3 or -3.

runtime: 1ms beats 22%
no. 1041. Robot Bounded In Circle {MEDIUM}
loop it 4 times to see if it goes back to (0,0) => in recursion to find the last location,
maybe there is a better way?

runtime: 2ms beats 20%
no. 1672 Richest Customer Wealth
O(m x n) => no other way but a question of java optimisation ==> streams parallel better or just 2 iterative for loops?

runtime: 0ms beats 100%
no. 1572 Matrix Diagonal Sum
O(n) => take note of how each index of the array correlates to which number gets selected in the particular row

[1,2,3] 0th index => row[0] = 1  row[length - 1 - *0*] = 3 sum -> 4
[4,5,6] 1st index => row[1] = 5  row[length - 1 - *1*] = 5 sum -> 4 + 5 (but we cannot double add this so always check if the [index] we are calling is the same) 
[7,8,9] 2nd index => row[2] = 9  row[length - 1 - *2*] = 7 sum -> 4 + 5 + 9 +7


runtime: 0ms beats 100%
no. 54 Spiral Matrix
O(nlogn) => travesering the matrices => include directions and boundaries and also extra conditions to handle edge cases
main thing to take note of was to properly handle each change in direction and proper boundary change 

runtime: 0ms beats 100%
no. 1523 Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range
just need to know the logic of math => (3,7) => 7-3+1 => to get numbers involved and then / 2 and + 1 if both are odd;

runtime: 2ms beats 5%
no.1491 Average Salary Excluding the Minimum and Maximum Salary
learnt about Integer.MAX_VALUE and Integer.MIN_VALUE => other than that solution would have been faster if i did not factor bigdecimal

runtime: 2ms beats 95.30%
no. 860 Lemonade Change
simple math executed with if else switch case conditions, just need to take note of using the $10 to change $20 first if we can.

runtime: 2ms beats 98.58%
no. 976 Largest Perimeter Triangle
focus on the rule of sum of 2 sides of triangle must be bigger than one side or the difference is smaller than one side
but when we sort the array => smaller to bigger: we only need to take a look at one rule as trivial solution
smallest + second smallest > third smallest to fulfil a triangle, this was O(n) +nlog(n) for sorting,
however to optimise for a few ms of runtime you can run this for loop from the back which i did to improve abit as the largest will always be at
the back or similarly sort with biggest => largest and loop from index 0.

runtime: 0ms beats 100%
no. 1232 Check if It Is a Straight Line
focus on the math part; y = mx + c => i made 3 flagging conditions either run = 0 -> this will check for x only -> straight horizontal line
rise = 0 -> this will check for y only because it is a straight vertical line
rise/run normal => will calculate for the c in y =mx + c -> check if the coordinate fit the equation.

runtime: 3ms beats 25%
no. 67 Add Binary
this was more of a technical difficulty i faced in trying to fix the number of runs, like different string with different lengths, java does not have negative indexing
like python where you can do string[-1] to start from the back, i used StringBuilder reverse and setLength to tackle this issue but need to find a more efficient way,
but runs the same time complexity

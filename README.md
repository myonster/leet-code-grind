8ms beats 92.59%
no.459 Repeated Substring Pattern 8/5/24
(better to use two pointer) my solution runs O(nlogn) but we can do it in O(n)

0ms beats 100%
no.66 Plus One 8/5/24
done iteratively

runtime: 0ms beats 100%
no. 1822 Signs of the Product on an Array
simple

runtime: 3ms beats 14%
no.1502 Can Make Arithmetic Progression From Sequence
simple 1. sort 2. check a[0] - a[1] and continue traversing

runtime: 1ms beats 98.59%
no.896 Monotonic Array
simple 1. set up 2 boolean condition => 1.presence of trend 2.increasing/decreasing ==> there will be a scenario where it just starts from 0 diff

runtime: 10ms beats 10%
no. 13 Roman to Integer
i used hashmap, solutions online used case and switch(have to learn more on this)
but both case it still O(n)

runtime: 0ms beats 100%
no. 58 Length of Last Word
simple built in java string methods => strip() to remove white spaces for edge cases and used lastIndexOf(" ")

runtime: 0ms beats 100%
no. 709. To Lower Case
simple built in syntax for java .toLowerCase();

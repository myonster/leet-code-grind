### Performance Notes

- **8ms beats 92.59%**  
**Problem**: no.459 Repeated Substring Pattern (8/5/24)  
**Note**: (better to use two pointer) my solution runs O(nlogn) but we can do it in O(n)

- **0ms beats 100%**  
**Problem**: no.66 Plus One (8/5/24)  
**Note**: done iteratively

- **0ms beats 100%**  
**Problem**: no. 1822 Signs of the Product on an Array  
**Note**: simple

- **3ms beats 14%**  
**Problem**: no.1502 Can Make Arithmetic Progression From Sequence  
**Note**: simple 1. sort 2. check `a[0] - a[1]` and continue traversing

- **1ms beats 98.59%**  
**Problem**: no.896 Monotonic Array  
**Note**: simple 1. set up 2 boolean condition => 1.presence of trend 2.increasing/decreasing ==> there will be a scenario where it just starts from 0 diff

- **10ms beats 10%**  
**Problem**: no. 13 Roman to Integer  
**Note**: i used hashmap, solutions online used case and switch(have to learn more on this) but both case it still O(n)

- **0ms beats 100%**  
**Problem**: no. 58 Length of Last Word  
**Note**: simple built in java string methods => strip() to remove white spaces for edge cases and used `lastIndexOf(" ")`

- **0ms beats 100%**  
**Problem**: no. 709 To Lower Case  
**Note**: simple built in syntax for java `.toLowerCase();`

- **2ms beats 88%**  
**Problem**: no. 682 Baseball Game  
**Note**: used stack to peek pop and push different operations to maintain O(1) operations to ensure O(N) for the whole algo

- **4ms beats 96.77%**  
**Problem**: no. 657 Robot Return to Origin  
**Note**: array size of 2 to depict x-y axis => each operation is used as moving along the graph O(n) time

- **0ms beats 100%**  
**Problem**: no. 1275 Find Winner on a Tic Tac Toe Game  
**Note**: Array question, i tackle it by giving making an large array so easier to count, there is 4 win con -> horizontal vertical and 2 diagonals for every position if we look at it from a free space board, so overflowing position counts will be added but it will be +0 count; player A was given positive -1 count for his position and player B was given -1 for his position, then we can just check if the one of the 4 win con adds up to +3 or -3.

- **1ms beats 22%**  
**Problem**: no. 1041 Robot Bounded In Circle {MEDIUM}  
**Note**: loop it 4 times to see if it goes back to (0,0) => in recursion to find the last location, maybe there is a better way?

- **2ms beats 20%**  
**Problem**: no. 1672 Richest Customer Wealth  
**Note**: O(m x n) => no other way but a question of java optimisation ==> streams parallel better or just 2 iterative for loops?

- **0ms beats 100%**  
**Problem**: no. 1572 Matrix Diagonal Sum  
**Note**: O(n) => take note of how each index of the array correlates to which number gets selected in the particular row [1,2,3] 0th index => row[0] = 1  row[length - 1 - *0*] = 3 sum -> 4 [4,5,6] 1st index => row[1] = 5  row[length - 1 - *1*] = 5 sum -> 4 + 5 (but we cannot double add this so always check if the [index] we are calling is the same) [7,8,9] 2nd index => row[2] = 9  row[length - 1 - *2*] = 7 sum -> 4 + 5 + 9 +7

- **0ms beats 100%**  
**Problem**: no. 54 Spiral Matrix  
**Note**: O(nlogn) => travesering the matrices => include directions and boundaries and also extra conditions to handle edge cases main thing to take note of was to properly handle each change in direction and proper boundary change 

- **0ms beats 100%**  
**Problem**: no. 1523 Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range  
**Note**: just need to know the logic of math => (3,7) => 7-3+1 => to get numbers involved and then / 2 and + 1 if both are odd;

- **2ms beats 5%**  
**Problem**: no.1491 Average Salary Excluding the Minimum and Maximum Salary  
**Note**: learnt about `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and `Integer.MIN_VALUE` => other than that solution would have been faster if i did not factor bigdecimal

- **2ms beats 95.30%**  
**Problem**: no. 860 Lemonade Change  
**Note**: simple math executed with if else switch case conditions, just need to take note of using the $10 to change $20 first if we can.

- **2ms beats 98.58%**  
**Problem**: no. 976 Largest Perimeter Triangle  
**Note**: focus on the rule of sum of 2 sides of triangle must be bigger than one side or the difference is smaller than one side but when we sort the array => smaller to bigger: we only need to take a look at one rule as trivial solution smallest + second smallest > third smallest to fulfil a triangle, this was O(n) +nlog(n) for sorting, however to optimise for a few ms of runtime you can run this for loop from the back which i did to improve abit as the largest will always be at the back or similarly sort with biggest => largest and loop from index 0.

- **0ms beats 100%**  
**Problem**: no. 1232 Check if It Is a Straight Line  
**Note**: focus on the math part; y = mx + c => i made 3 flagging conditions either run = 0 -> this will check for x only -> straight horizontal line rise = 0 -> this will check for y only because it is a straight vertical line rise/run normal => will calculate for the c in y =mx + c -> check if the coordinate fit the equation.

- **3ms beats 25%**  
**Problem**: no. 67 Add Binary  
**Note**: this was more of a technical difficulty i faced in trying to fix the number of runs, like different string with different lengths, java does not have negative indexing like python where you can do string[-1] to start from the back, i used StringBuilder reverse and setLength to tackle this issue but need to find a more efficient way, but runs the same time complexity

- **3ms beats 59.14%**  
**Problem**: no. 43 Multiply Strings  
**Note**: not allowed to use BigInteger or directly convert to int, so I did this in a more traditional algorithm, multiplying two numbers just like in primary school it uses O(m+n) space complexity and run in O(m*n) time complexity, i init an array of m+n size because 2 numbers multiplied will always result in a maximum of m + n digits and then loop the first number from first digit to multiply with a loop of digits of the second number, with the add and 'carry over' the excess sum logic, after the first digit of the first number, i will then traverse to add the index of array for the next digit and repeat.

- **26 ms beats 5%**
**Problem**: no. 50 Pow(x,n)
**Note**: tasked to implement power, used recursion to achieve O(logn) but had difficulties with handling edge cases like `INTEGER.MAX_VALUE` and `INTEGER.MIN_VALUE`

- **0ms beats 100%**
**Problem**: no. 21 Merge Two Sorted Lists
**Note**: List node is a data structure which holds a val and next, use recursion to check curr and then if null return the other and continue passing on until reach base case.

- **0ms beats 100%**
**Problem**: no. 206 Reverse Linked List
**Note**: an easy problem but implementing the logic of reversing the nodes were abit confusing at first, i did it by creating a new node to handle the current node and point to the previous node.

- **1ms beats 100%**
**Problem**: no. 2 Add Two Numbers
**Note**: medium question, logic was easy as i just had to keep track of which curr i am pointing to for both ListNodes, had alot of difficulty in trying to implement the result node
like i wasn't very sure how to keep track of the current and then next (`nodeToLookAt`) so in the end i init 2 nodes one that initially pointed to `nodeToLookAt` and then just kept changing the next node of `nodeToLookAt`,
and then returned a .next.next of the head node `resultNode`.

- **2ms beats 98%**
**Problem**: no. 1 Two Sum
**Note**: a very classic problem that can be approached in many ways, i did hashmap where i go through the array from index 0, each time i come across a number i will minus from target and see `containsKey()` in java HashMap
with O(1) time complexity, if there is a complement of that number then return the respective index and if there is not then insert into the hashmap... can this be done with a HashSet knowing that the array is not sorted and we need to return the following indexes.

- **2ms beats 98%**
**Problem**: no. 20 Valid Parentheses
**Note**: classic stack problem, just be careful of the logic, every opening bracket push into stack, every closing bracket we have to first check if we are pushing into an empty stack, this will be invalid immediately, next we check if the closing bracket matches the popped bracket from the stack.
in the end after we have looped through we can return if the stack is empty because there might be a scenario where there are only opening brackets and fill the stack.
